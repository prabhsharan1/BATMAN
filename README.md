The logo features a black bat with outspread wings, with the upper portion of the bat in a shape of a yellow ellipse. The symbol was created by Batman's co-creator Bob Kane and first appeared in 1939.

* The logo has undergone several redesigns over the years, but the basic bat shape has remained the same. The iconic design has become one of the most recognizable symbols in popular culture.

* The bat symbol represents Batman's identity as a vigilante and his fear-inspiring tactics to fight crime. The bat also represents his connection to the animal kingdom and his ability to strike fear into the hearts of criminals.

* The Batman logo has appeared in various forms of media, including comic books, movies, TV shows, video games and merchandise. It is also used as the logo for Batman's secret hideout, the Batcave.

* It is also notable that the Batman logo has been adapted to many other forms, such as a bat signal, which is a search light with a stylized bat symbol, used by the Gotham City police department to call Batman for help, this has also been adapted to many forms of media too.


<h2> Intro To Pyhton Turtle </h2>

* Python turtle is a library in Python that allows users to create simple graphical programs using a turtle that can move around the screen. The turtle can be controlled using a set of simple commands, such as forward, backward, left, and right, to move the turtle in different directions. The turtle can also change its color, shape, and size, as well as draw lines and shapes on the screen.

* The turtle library is part of the standard Python library and does not need to be installed separately. It is often used in educational settings as an introduction to programming and computer graphics.

* To use the turtle library in a Python script, you need to import it using the following statement:

**import turtle**

Once imported, you can create a turtle object and use its methods to control the turtle's movement and drawing on the screen.

* For example, to make the turtle move forward by 100 units and turn right by 90 degrees:

**import turtle**

**my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()**
**my_turtle.forward(100)**
**my_turtle.right(90)**

The turtle module also have some built-in methods that allow you to create shapes, like circles, squares and etc.

It is also worth mentioning that turtle library is mostly used by children and beginners in the world of programming and it is a good way to start learning programming and logic.

<h3> Drawing using python turtle is a simple and fun way to create graphics and animations using Python. The turtle library provides a set of simple commands that can be used to control the turtle's movement and drawing on the screen. </h3>
